# LeetCode
Leet Code - Training Easy and Medium leet code levels. Focusing on specific Embedded systems related topics

##### Topics to Prioritize:
For embedded systems, focus on problems that align with:

1. Bit Manipulation: Learn to work with bits efficiently (important for low-level programming).
1. Arrays and Strings: Understanding memory layouts and manipulation.
1. Recursion: Often comes up in embedded system logic (e.g., state machines, tree traversal).
1. Dynamic Programming: Basic familiarity; it's less common but useful for optimization problems.
1. Sorting and Searching: Binary search and sorting algorithms are frequently discussed.
1. Graphs (Basic): Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) may occasionally be relevant.
